# Predictive-Analysis-Of-Fresh-water-reserves

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project developed in a Jupyter Notebook. The project aims to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from a dataset using Python libraries.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: The notebook demonstrates how to load data from various sources and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and erroneous entries.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applies transformations to enhance data quality and usability.
- **Modeling**: Includes steps for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes findings and insights derived from the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
